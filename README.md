# Knock-A-Ghost

We are a nft based art studio, trying to set our feets in the field of game development and designing.

Since a while we are working on a javascript based RPG game which can be played online on any web browser. Knock-a-Ghost is one of our early development and we are progressing fast to integrate multiplayer functionality as well as smart contract to reward the players based upon their score.

You can play the game here: https://art-maniac.github.io/Quick_3D_RPG/
